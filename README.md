Prerequisites:
MATLAB should be installed.
For executing the words_tweeted scrip, MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox is required and should be installed.

Creating Executable File:
This can be done by typing deploytool at the MATLAB prompt and intuitively following the
prompts.
Running Installation: MATLAB Compiler Runtime is required.

1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

. Verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 8.3 (R2014a).   

. If the MCR is not installed, do the following:
  
  (1) enter
  
      >>mcrinstaller
      
      at MATLAB prompt. The MCRINSTALLER command displays the 
      location of the MCR Installer.

  (2) run the MCR Installer.

Or download the Windows 64-bit version of the MCR for R2014a 
from the MathWorks Web site by navigating to

For more information about the MCR and the MCR Installer, see 
Distribution to End Users in the MATLAB Compiler documentation  
in the MathWorks Documentation Center.    


NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run MCRInstaller.
